                <h1>Getting Started</h1>
                <p>
                    Welcome to the first part of your journey to learning Unix. Here you will learn all the 
                    things you need to know before starting with commands.  The topics will include an 
                    explanation of what Unix is, why we are using it, an introduction to file structure, and 
                    what the terminal is.
                </p><br><br>

            <h2>What is Unix</h2>
            <p>
                Unix is a computer operating system that can handle activities from multiple users at the 
                same time. Multitasking can be done by a user. Unix is also the first operating system to 
                be written in a higher-level language (C Language). Being written in C allowed the 
                operating system to be ported to other machines with minimal adaptations.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Why use Unix? (sub head under what is unix?)</h3>
            <p>
                Unix is designed to share! In web development, you usually work in groups and need 
                to share information easily with your peers. It is easy to install and more than one 
                person can log in at a time to do work. Unix is also more secure than other operating 
                systems. This is because you can control all processes in Unix.
            </p><br>

            <h2>File Structure</h2>
            <p>
                Unix is organized in a hierarchical file structure. This allows for easier access and 
                maintenance of data. This should be familiar to Microsoft Windows users because they 
                use the same structure.
            </p><br>
            
            <p>The top-level directory is called root(written as slash /). From the root, the tree grows downward.</p><br>

            <p>At the end of each path, an ordinary file or directory will be found. In this diagram, ordinary files are rectangles and directories have curved edges.</p><br>

            <p>Ordinary files are normal files. They are files that can hold documents, pictures, programs, and other kinds of data but do not support other paths.</p><br>

            <p>Directories can hold ordinary files or more directories allowing growth. They are also known as folders. Directories directly connected by a path are called parents (closer to the root) and children (farther from the root).</p><br>

            <h3>Filenames (sub head)</h3>
            <p>
                All files have a name. The names for files can reach up to 255 characters long. No two names in a directory 
                are the same. If files are in separate directories they can share the same name. In Unix, the operating 
                system is case-sensitive. This means you can name a file <strong>monday, Monday, or MONDAY</strong> and this 
                would represent three different files.
            </p><br>

            <p>These are the characters you can use to name your files.</p>

            <ul id="characters_list">
                <li>Uppercase letters (A-Z)</li>
                <li>Lowercase letters (a-z)</li>
                <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
                <li>Underscore( _ )</li>
                <li>Period ( . )</li>
                <li>Comma ( , )</li>
            </ul><br>

            <p>
                A file that begins with a period is called a hidden file. When using the command “ls”, hidden files 
                will not appear. Do not worry, you can still see these files if you use the command “ls -a”. We will 
                go in-depth about this in a later section.
            </p>
