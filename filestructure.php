        <h1>File Structure</h1>


        <p>
            Unix is organized in a hierarchical file structure. This allows for easier access and
            maintenance of data. This should be familiar to Microsoft Windows users because they
            use the same structure.
        </p><br>

        <p>The top-level directory is called root(written as slash /). From the root, the tree grows downward.</p><br>

        <p>At the end of each path, an ordinary file or directory will be found. In this diagram, ordinary files are
            rectangles and directories have curved edges.</p><br>

        <p>Ordinary files are normal files. They are files that can hold documents, pictures, programs, and other kinds
            of
            data but do not support other paths.</p><br>

        <p>Directories can hold ordinary files or more directories allowing growth. They are also known as folders.
            Directories directly connected by a path are called parents (closer to the root) and children (farther from
            the
            root).</p><br>

        <h2>Filenames</h2>
        <p>
            All files have a name. The names for files can reach up to 255 characters long. No two names in a directory
            are the same. If files are in separate directories they can share the same name. In Unix, the operating
            system is case-sensitive. This means you can name a file <strong>monday, Monday, or MONDAY</strong> and this
            would represent three different files.
        </p><br>

        <p>These are the characters you can use to name your files.</p>

        <ul id="characters_list">
            <li>Uppercase letters (A-Z)</li>
            <li>Lowercase letters (a-z)</li>
            <li>Numbers (0-9)</li>
            <li>Underscore( _ )</li>
            <li>Period ( . )</li>
            <li>Comma ( , )</li>
        </ul><br>

        <p>
            A file that begins with a period is called a hidden file. When using the command “ls”, hidden files
            will not appear. Do not worry, you can still see these files if you use the command “ls -a”. We will
            go in-depth about this in a later section.
        </p>

        <h2>Pathnames</h2>
        <p>
            Every file has a pathname. A pathname is a statement of the location of a file or other item in a
            hierarchy of directories.
